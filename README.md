# race_strat_project
A program that can formulate a race strategy based on the car, track, length of the race, etc.

##Program Flow
1. Data Entry: User enters the **game/simulator being used**, **car being used**, **track being used**, if the race will be **time or lap based**, and if the race is **multiclass**.
   - The game/simulator being used will determine if the  Car, track, and classes beig used are in the game/simulator, as well as the stint limit options if they exist. Additionaly, the time that each action in a pit stop takes. 
   - The car being used by the player as well as the track being used will give he user will determine the **class** that the player is in, the number of **fuel maps** that can be used,and the **lap times** that the program can worth with, based on the track given.
   - The track being use determines the legth of time a pitstop takes, whick can ne added to the time of the stop itself.
   - If there is limits on the sitint applicible, the number of laps in a given time or time for a number of laps can be calculated.
   - Determining if there are additional classes in the race, we can determine if the amout of laps will change for out user depending on the speed of the other classes.
