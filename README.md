# race_strat_project
A program that can formulate a race strategy based on the car, track, length of the race, etc.

##Program Flow
1. Data Entry: User enters the **game/simulator being used**, **car being used**, **track being used**, if the race will be **time or lap based**, and if the race is **multiclass**.
   - The game/simulator being used will determine if the  Car, track, and classes beig used are in the game/simulator, as well as the stint limit options if they exist. Additionaly, the time that each action in a pit stop takes. 
   - The car being used by the player as well as the track being used will give he user will determine the **class** that the player is in, the number of **fuel maps** that can be used,and the **lap times** that the program can worth with, based on the track given.
   - The track being use determines the legth of time a pitstop takes, whick can ne added to the time of the stop itself.
   - If there is limits on the sitint applicible, the number of laps in a given time or time for a number of laps can be calculated.
   - Determining if there are additional classes in the race, we can determine if the amout of laps will change for out user depending on the speed of the other classes.
2. Reesult creation
   - If the race has a class faster than the player, then the amout will need to be found and then enterend in before the main loop can be exicuted.
   - The loop will be limited by the amouit f laps that can be done.
   - the laps are then simulated, allowing foir the consumible items to ware out and, if applicallbe, the stint to end befre a pit stop is made and the needed items are found.
4. Result printting: Prits the result f the code when the buttoon is hit
